# 4. Explain Seaborn and write any 4 plots included in it.
# Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib that provides a high-level
# interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. It simplifies the process of
# creating complex plots by offering built-in themes, color palettes, and specialized functions for
# visualizing relationships in datasets.

# Seaborn supports a wide variety of plot types, including:
    # 1. Relational plots (e.g., scatter plots, line plots)
    # 2. Categorical plots (e.g., box plots, bar plots, violin plots)
    # 3. Distribution plots (e.g., histograms, KDE plots)
    # 4. Regression plots

# Seaborn is particularly well-suited for working with Pandas dataframes, making it easy to
# visualize data trends and relationships across different dimensions. It enhances visualizations
# with less code and produces more informative plots than raw Matplotlib, especially when it
# comes to handling statistical data.

# Installation:
# To use Seaborn, you need to install it first. You can do this using pip:
# pip install seaborn
# These plots, along with Seabornâ€™s rich set of features, make it a powerful tool for data
# visualization in Python.
